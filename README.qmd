The following code is based on the recent book release: *Practical Guide to Applied Conformal Prediction in Python*. After posting a fuzzy GIF on X & receiving a lot of requests for a blog or Github repo, this repo includes the practical guide with applications in R, instead of Python.  

This is not copy/paste direct replica of the python notebook or book, this is a lite, supplemental R guide, & documentation for R users.
